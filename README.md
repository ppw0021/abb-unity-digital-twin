# 🛠️ Unity Digital Twin (In Progress)

A digital twin of the ABB Dual Arm YuMi® IRB 14000 robot, built in Unity for simulation and visualization purposes. This project aims to mirror real-world robotic behaviour and interactions for industrial and educational use cases.

## 🚧 Status
**In Progress** — Actively developing core features like real-time motion syncing, environment modelling, and UI controls.

## 🎯 Goals
- Simulate real-world robot behaviour
- Enable live control and data visualization
- Integrate with sensor or PLC inputs (future)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Unity (3D engine)
- C#
- ROS/PLC Integration (planned)
